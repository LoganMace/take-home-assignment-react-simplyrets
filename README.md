# Code and Design Decisions

- Used a combination of SCSS and BEM classNames for the styling to take advantage of nested syntax and more readable styling.
- Took advantage of css grid to handle the responsiveness of the property listings.
- Pulled out all formatting functions into a helper file to keep components clean.
- Stuck with jest/react-testing-library for unit tests.
- Extensive destructuring to limit repeated code.

# Unfinished due to time constraint

- Caching listings and favorites to local storage.
- Full test coverage.
- Better error handling.
- Adding typescript or alternate typing solution.
- Better accessibility.
- Add loading state for api call.
